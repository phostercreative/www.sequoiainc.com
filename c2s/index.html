      <p>Sequoiaâ€™s Data Scientists work beside policy makers and program management to design and implement the necessary models, algorithms and visualization to help organizations distill insights from very large disparate data sources.  For example, Sequoia worked with a team of data scientists to architect a solution using Apache Spark to evaluate clustering algorithms over several time series datasets.  Sequoia personnel also applied novel graph visualization techniques to help evaluate results set and assisted in developing a custom application using Java, the Scala programming language and Hadoop HDFS.</p>
