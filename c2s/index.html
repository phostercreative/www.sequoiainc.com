      <h2 class="what_we_do-item_heading">Big Data Solutions</h2>
      <p>Sequoia is playing a key role in the design and implementation of a big-data “hub” solution based upon the Cloudera software stack.  This system will be the primary focal point for our customer’s ingest, storage and analytic solution, supporting both batch and near-real-time use cases for applications and ad hoc data science.  Technologies include HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), Hive (Hadoop Data Warehouse), Flume (high-volume ingest), Neo4J (graph database) Kafka (distributed message queue) and Spark (cluster computing framework).  Sequoia is a recognized Cloudera consulting partner.</p>

      <h2 class="what_we_do-item_heading">Data Science &#038; Analytics</h2>
      <p>Sequoia’s Data Scientists work beside policy makers and program management to design and implement the necessary models, algorithms and visualization to help organizations distill insights from very large disparate data sources.  For example, Sequoia worked with a team of data scientists to architect a solution using Apache Spark to evaluate clustering algorithms over several time series datasets.  Sequoia personnel also applied novel graph visualization techniques to help evaluate results set and assisted in developing a custom application using Java, the Scala programming language and Hadoop HDFS.</p>

      <p>Sequoia personnel conduct technical operations in austere environments, leading war on terror efforts with technical experts working side-by-side with war fighters, creating strong liaison relationships to rebuild national infrastructure and enabling autonomous governance by host country leaders.  Sequoia personnel currently deliver expert operational risk assessments of forward deployed technologies in mission critical arenas, guaranteeing officer awareness of the vulnerabilities that may be inherent in and/or jeopardize their personal safety or operation(s).</p>
