RESTON, VA – July 26, 2015: Sequoia Holdings, Inc. will be bursting onto the scene at DEFCON for its first time in a most disruptive way – Welcome to Sequoia’s “Drone Fight Club.” Two quadcopter drone operators at a time will be randomly selected to fight it out in the Sequoia Drone Fight Arena, until one drone is disabled or destroyed. The Drone battles will begin at this Official DEFCON 23 Party on Friday, August 7th, 2015, at 7:00pm. Traditional Fight Club Rules will be employed, with the location and access to this space-limited event to be released through Sequoia’s social media channels.

“We are proud to be selected to host this exciting official event for our first DEFCON,” said T.
