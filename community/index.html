  <p>Sequoia supports many global and local nonprofit organizations annually because we believe giving back is the right thing to do.  We understand that the success of our organization is tied to the success of our business partners, our clients, and most importantly, the success of the community in which we do business.  Helping others is instilled within our corporate culture, within each and every employee, and the way in which we conduct business with our clients.</p>
  <p>Below are just a few causes we support with our people, our services and our spirit.</p>
